## Content based e-book recommendations
This repo contains notebooks and data used to explore content based book recommendations using a subset of ebook data taken from [Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

### Dependencies
```cd``` into the notebook directory and run the following.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Previewing the notebook

I've found that sometimes the notebook files take awhile to load inside github, and because I use deepnote for most of my own notebook work, it only makes sense to provide a share link for you to jump right in!
